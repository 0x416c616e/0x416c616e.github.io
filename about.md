I'm Alan, a computer science student currently participarting in the [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge. I studied IT at College of DuPage before transferring to Southern Illinois University Edwardsville to study CS. I am very passionate about software development and information security. I am currently in Chicagoland, though I spent 2016-2018 in the greater St. Louis area (and briefly in China in 2018).

The platforms I use regularly are macOS Mojave, Windows 10, Debian-based GNU/Linux distros (Kali/Debian/Ubuntu), CloudLinux, FreeBSD, iOS, and Android. My strongest skills are Java and mobile-friendly, responsive web development. I also know shell scripting, C++, Python, Swift, git, full stack development, and markup, such as LaTeX, YAML, JSON, UML, and Markdown. I have developed websites using the MEAN stack, jQuery, Bootstrap, LAMP (with an emphasis on frontend), Wordpress, and now Jekyll. 

Some other websites I've made include [Smart Financial Research](https://smartfinancialresearch.com), [Hello Life Skills](https://hellolifeskills.com), [Saint Louis Software](https://saintlouissoftware.com), and more. 

Some people use [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode) to start learning about programming. I already learned how to code in university, but now I'm taking this time to build a portfolio of useful projects, aside from only concentrating on class assignments and tests.

This site is currently hosted on Github Pages. The git repo is available [here](https://github.com/0x416c616e/0x416c616e.github.io). Soon, I will transfer it to being generated with my own Python program called Static Site Generator.
