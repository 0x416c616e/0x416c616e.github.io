## People act like you're dead if you don't check for phone 24/7

I've found that the best way for me to be productive is to either turn off my phone, or at least not check it very often. I turn it to silent or vibrate instead of having sounds on, and nowadays I will have it farther away from me, instead of right next to me or in my pocket. I don't check social media as often either. I also don't check the news as much. Because of all these things, I am able to achieve longer uninterrupted periods of productivity. Small distractions here and there can ruin your workflow. But some people dislike that. They want you to be available 24/7, able to respond instantly, and if you don't, then people will sometims take that personally.

People think phones and apps are cheap, but they really aren't. A free app demands your most valuable resource of all: your time. I know some people who practically live on Facebook and Twitter. I'd never get anything done if all I did was check app notifications all day. In fact, I've disabled a lot of notifications, or just flat out ignore some. 

It's not that I dislike people or don't want to talk to them, but maybe we should rethink the idea of being instantly available for everything all of the time. I need fewer distractions in order to get more work done. 

It feels liberating to spend less time checking your phone. I'm glad I've made this decision, but some people think it's a bad thing.
