## Resuming after a long hiatus

It's been a long time since my last #100daysofcode post, but a lot has happened in my life. I moved, dealt with health stuff, transferred to NEIU for computer science in the fall, and a lot more!

Some projects I've been working on recently include a book about software development and an online course about investing. I've also been building a DIY recording studio and a rack-mount home lab with various servers, routers, switches, access points, a PBX, NAS server, domain controller, patch panel, IoT hub, echo dot, and separate subnets for various things. 

Even though I moved back to Chicagoland, I still take trips back to St. Louis every now and then, such as for July 4th. 

Today I worked on my book more. I wrote the finishing parts about Python and now I'm starting a section on C++. After the C++ section is finished, all that's left are the PHP and SQL sections of the book.

The point of my book is to show my knowledge while also helping beginners learn it too. It's a resume-padding project but hopefully it will be useful to at least a small number of people. 

Here's the book cover:

So far, the book is 480 pages long. It's not finished though.

I wrote the book in LibreOffice before switching to Microsoft Word. I used Grammarly for editing and Fiverr for the book cover. I'm planning on using Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) to release it as an e-book using the Kindle Create program. I also made some diagrams for the book using GIMP. There are lots of code examples in it. 

I've done a lot of editing, restructuring, and deleting in the book. As long as the book is now, I've actually deleted a few chapters of content because it wasn't completely relevant. I used to have more memoir stuff, but now it's more code-focused. 

## New tools and skills

It's been a while since the last time I wrote an entry for this site, so here are some new things going on:

- I've learned to make GUI applications in Python.
- Lately, I've been mostly using Windows 10 rather than macOS, which is what I used to use all the time. 
- I use an Android phone instead of an iPhone now. 
- I've been using Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, CLion, Bitnami LAMP, Git Bash, ConEmu, and the new Windows Terminal.
- I've been teaching myself a lot about audio engineering because I'm doing media production for finance/investing education lectures that will eventually go on Udemy. Some of the software I use for audio is WavePad, Voicemeeter, the Windows Control Panel Sound menu, and Audacity. I also use Movie Studio for video editing and Teleprompter Pro for pacing my reading when I record lectures.
- On my phone, I've been using some new apps, such as Airbnb, Uber, Termux, Stitcher, Amazon Alexa, Audible, Passport Parking, 3Plus Elite, and some smart home-related apps.
- I've been using Grammarly for grammar editing.

## Podcasts and audiobooks for long drives

I listen to a lot of tech podcasts now, including the following: 

## Miscellaneous

I've been reading a lot of tech-related books, which can be found on my GoodReads profile. I also joined a new gym.
I haven't been working much on my open source side projects, but my book contains a fair amount of code. The #100daysofcode challenge involves coding for one hour per day, and today I've spent well over an hour on coding for my book, so I think that counts.
