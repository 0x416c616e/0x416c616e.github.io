## Distractions destroy productivity

Today I'd like to talk about something I've noticed about productivity. It's not specific to today, but in general, the concept of "being in the zone" can really affect how much work you can accomplish. 

Little distractions like phone notifications, meetings, calls, and so on can really take your mind out of your work.

It can take a while to get in the zone, and when you're there, you don't want to leave. When you first get up in the morning, shower, shave, get dressed, and start to code, at first you're not as productive as you can be. You're not only just waking up, maybe still digesting food and figuring out plans for the day, but you might have also just had a conversation with someone, or thought about your commute. 

It takes a while to be fully alert, clear your mind of all distractions, not be hungry or have any other physical needs, and then be left alone to do your work. It takes a significant amount of time to get in the zone, but it doesn't take much at all to take you out of it. Someone asking you for help for something, getting lunch, going to the restroom... there are so many things that can take your mind away from your work. A "15 minute" meeting might actually cost you over an hour of productivity because of the lingering thoughts in your head that make you code more slowly. 

When you finally get in the zone for programming, even if it's only for a few hours in a day, you can get much more accomplished in a short amount of time. 

Thne it's late, and you're still in the zone, and you don't want to leave, because you know even 15 minutes of coding in the zone can be more productive than the first hour of the next day because you'll have to reorient yourself and remember all of what you were doing and everything you need to consider. 

## Music

Some people might think of music as entertainment or a distraction, but I personally find music to be a helpful tool to help me pace myself and also get in the zone, tuning out background noises and other thoughts. When you're thinking about music and programming, there isn't room for much else to go on. Music can also change your emotional state, based on what kind of music it is. 

Some music is very demanding of your attention, with lyrics that make you think about whatever it is the person is talking about. But if you listen to instrumental music, it's a more cerebral experience that won't mess up your thoughts or take you out of the zone.

Basically, background music, like from soundtracks, or just music that otherwise doesn't have any singing/lyrics, actually bolsters my programming ability and concentration, so long as it isn't too intense. 

There are really two categories of music I listen to: music for active listening, and music for passive listening. Active listening distracts you and gets you to fully concentrate on the music. This is good for concerts or leisure, but not so great for getting work done. On the other hand, passive listening music might seem less interesting when you're doing absolutely nothing else and only focusing on the music, but it helps as a background element when you're focusing on something else.
