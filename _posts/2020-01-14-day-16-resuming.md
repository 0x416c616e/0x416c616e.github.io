# Back after some interruptions

I was sick for a little while, so I didn't really do much coding then. I won't count those days towards the 100 days.

# More Python Crash Course

Today, I finished chapter 4, and also did chapters 5-7. Also updated my log and website here. A couple days of being out of the loop is bad, so I'm getting back into the swing of things.

One issue I have with a lot of Python learning resources I'm looking up is that they assume you've never programmed before, so they spend way too much time going over basic concepts. It's really boring. I wish there were more programming books aimed at people that already know a couple programming languages and just want a quick way to get up to speed with the language without going over the basics of programming and OOP paradigm stuff that I've already learned. 

I have also decided that I will be writing my own ticketing system instead of using osTicket. It will be a good first full stack web development project for Python/Django/SQLite. 

## Static site generator

I am still working on the static site generator project. Not only am I learning more about Python still, but I am also doing more mockups and planning about what the program will be like.

I am also starting on a command line version of the program rather than starting out with the GUI version. I will add the GUI stuff later.
