## Healthcare appointment

Sometimes, real life gets in the way of programming, at least for personal projects as opposed to work. But then again, if I only programmed on perfect days, I'd probably never get anything done. So despite having other obligations, I decided to do at least some programming and learning today. Not all days will involve an equal amount of programming or education, but it's important to do at least a little bit every single day or else you'll get out of the habit. Practice doesn't make perfect, but practice makes routine.

Health problems can get in the way of programming, among other things. Getting healthcare is very important.
