## Free old computer

I got an old computer for free. I am going to turn this into a Windows Server project for learning more about enterprise tech, like Windows Server, Active Directory, and maybe LDAP. 

It will require some preparation first though.

## More learning

Continued to do more Python Crash Course book stuff and GitHub Ultimate Udemy course stuff too.
