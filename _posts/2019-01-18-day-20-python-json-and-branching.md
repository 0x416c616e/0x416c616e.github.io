## Branching

I sort of learned about branching a while ago, but I've decided to start using it now. I will at least do feature branches and then merge them back into master when I'm done.

## Unit testing

I'm not really sure where to start with things like unit testing, continuous integration, etc. I want to start incorporating that kind of stuff into my workflow though.

## SQL in 10 Minutes

I want to do another chapter of this today. 

## JSON

More JSON learning for my SSG project.

## Python

I made more progress on my static site generator.
