## Moving on from EZcrypt

For the past couple days, I've been working on my site and my encryption/decryption tool, but I've basically finished it. There are some small changs I could make, but for the most part, it does what it needs to. So it's time to move on to another project I've been wanting to work on for a while. So what will I work on next?
