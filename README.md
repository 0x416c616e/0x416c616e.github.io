## Alan's 100 Days of Code (alans100daysofcode.com)

This is my website where I post daily updates about my programming and learning. I've gone to college for IT and computer science, which I will resume in the fall. But right now, among other things, I am teaching myself a lot of prorgamming on my own, and making a software portfolio consisting of many open source personal projects.

Currently, the site was made with Jekyll. However, I am working on a static site generator of my own called Static Site Generator, which is being written in Python. Eventually, that will replace Jekyll. I am making my own tools and it's very fun, educational, and empowering to do so.

My main website, at least for now, is still [Saint Louis Software](https://saintlouissoftware.com). As the name implies, Alan's 100 Days of Code is just a temporary project, which will over after 100 days. Maybe I will continue to do a lot of programming after that, but there might be other things going on that will take precedence over open source. But I will at least be finishing the #100daysofcode challenge. 

It's been really great so far and I highly encourage other people to try it too (if you haven't already). I had prior programming experience, but even beginners can try it. It's cool to look back and see what you did in an approximately 3 month time frame.

## Converting to a book

After it's done, I will convert the entries to a book, maybe called something like Musings On Open Source Software Development.

- When people are wrong about tech and will not budge even when you tell them otherwise
- Bad tech startups that make more money from angel investors than customers
- Other areas for tech, aside from Silicon Valley (Beijing, Austin, etc.)
- Technology isn't really here until it's affordable -- we currently have robot assistants, and other expensive/impractical tech, but unless the cost goes down and it becomes more useful, to justify the cost, then it's just a novelty
- Early adopters vs. waiting until something is more tried-and-true
- RISC-V and open source hardware
- My experiences with 3D printing
- Automation and some misconceptions about it
- Neural networks -- changing things randomly and hoping it gets better
- Containers and container orchestration
- How higher levels of abstraction allow for people to forget about lower-level stuff, and how this can lead to problems later down the road, where people forget things and people retire, so there's legacy or underlying low-level hardware stuff that is important but people don't know how to maintain or use it
- Backlash against data mining, Facebook is an uncool company
- Shorter lifespan for tech companies compared to other industries
- How tech is changing non-tech industries
- My early years of trying to program, but knowing nothing about it, and doing things the wrong way (starting in like 2007)
- Marketing yourself on social media ("personal branding")
- Interview stuff
- People think reading books makes you smart, but it's kind of a dying medium, compared to websites, apps, social media, etc.
- How certain things in this writing/book will become obsolete by the time some people read it in the future
	- Watching old Defcon talks or old tech tutorials is a weird experience, because in its time, they were new and relevant and high-tech, and now, they just look old and obsolete
- Securing yourself is harding than hacking -- it's asymmetric
- Non-traditional programmers -- self-taught, night classes, older than most students, open source, but not necessarily working as a software developer
- How to deal with a client whose software requirements are bad and need to be revised
- Write more about malware, scams, etc. Examples: rootkits, link shorteners, trojanized torrents, and so on.
- The downsides of tech -- how it's bad for us, physically and mentally (sleep, f.lux, instant gratification, etc.)
- What you want your code to do isn't the same as what it actually does
- Nostalgia and old tech -- it can be old and inferior, but people think fondly of it anyway
- Dangers of social media
- Writing for programmers vs. writing for non-technical audiences
- Why are security researchers expected to also be great public speakers?
- Tech snake oil
- Cryptocurrency and its numerous problems
- Dark web, deep web, etc.
- Talking with people online who are from different parts of the world
- New social media is self-absorbed, but old web forums were more about interacting with other people
- No current social media will be around forever, it all has a limited shelf life
- When developing software, think about the user, who might not be from a tecnical background
- The digital divide
- Being the family tech support person even though you're primarily a software developer, not in computer repair
- How and why I got into tech
- Living in completely different worlds -- that Toastmasters guy talking about nwspaper ads even though newspapers are dying
- Generational differences and tech
- Neoluddism
- People who overestimate their tech skills
- Building computers: how, why, and it's kind of therapeutic
- How building computers has changed over time (ex: cases used to have very sharp metal)
- English words in programming language syntax
- Analogies and metaphors used in tech naming
- There's more to my life and identity than tech, but sometimes people label me as "the tech guy" because they don't know me well or just want a lazy way to categorize someone
- People who make the mistake of getting a gaming PC "for computer science" in college and then clearly aren't that interested in programming itself
- Back when I had a 4.0 and spent too much time studying and not enough time on more important things
- How I use flash cards and notes for studying
- How people who think they're smart will present information in an intentionally-confusing way in an attempt to look smart, like the calculus tutor I once had who showed me formulas I didn't encounter in the textbook yet, because he wanted to show off his math knowledge, even though it was not related to what we were going over. That's different from programming, which is supposed to be easy to read. 
- Lots of useless learning in academia vs. practical things that can be used in the real world, and people thinking complex/difficult = good
- Simple solutions are the best, and simple explanations are the best
- Programming and critical thinking
- Dishonest ways people can advance their careers in tech
- Non-contributions, such as fixing a typo in a readme
- "What you don't know won't hurt you" -- bad attitude about data mining from people who barely even know how to type a password, let alone wrap their head around concepts like data mining and app permissions
- Why privacy is valuable
- My social media strategy and some obvious mistakes to avoid (like following 50k people, or posting controversial things)
- PCI and other regulatory compliance stuff doesn't guarantee security
- Is security even possible?
- Important historical figures in computer science and technology
- Why I left IT for CS
- When to cancel a project because it's not feasible, too many bugs, people aren't working well together, etc.
	- Sunk cost fallacy
- When non-tech people talk about an app idea, they concentrate only on features. When I come up with an app idea, I think about cost, development time, how difficult it would be to make it, monetization (or a lack thereof), competing apps, and how good it would look on my resume and/or website.
- Write about my Abyss Dropper and file upload vulnerability stuff I've been working on, and also write about bug bounties in general
- It's not just computers and phones -- mention how software and computers are used for elevators, trains, air traffic control, air conditioning, physical security systems, embedded devices (and the difference between embedded and IoT), etc.
- Security monocultures and Linux in everything
- Convert some of my old security presentation slides (and SLS website blog post) to writing for this website/book
- Shodan
- Malware having repercussions in the "real world" such as Stuxnet and other SCADA/ICS stuff
- There is less of a gap between "real world" and online now, compared to in the past (also: public but seems private with computer rooms/home offices)
- Will tech innovations eventually slow down like other industries?
