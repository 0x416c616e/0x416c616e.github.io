## Alan's 100 Days of Code (alans100daysofcode.com)

This is my website where I post daily updates about my programming and learning. I've gone to college for IT and computer science, which I will resume in the fall. But right now, among other things, I am teaching myself a lot of prorgamming on my own, and making a software portfolio consisting of many open source personal projects.

Currently, the site was made with Jekyll. However, I am working on a static site generator of my own called Static Site Generator, which is being written in Python. Eventually, that will replace Jekyll. I am making my own tools and it's very fun, educational, and empowering to do so.

My main website, at least for now, is still [Saint Louis Software](https://saintlouissoftware.com). As the name implies, Alan's 100 Days of Code is just a temporary project, which will over after 100 days. Maybe I will continue to do a lot of programming after that, but there might be other things going on that will take precedence over open source. But I will at least be finishing the #100daysofcode challenge. 

It's been really great so far and I highly encourage other people to try it too (if you haven't already). I had prior programming experience, but even beginners can try it. It's cool to look back and see what you did in an approximately 3 month time frame.
