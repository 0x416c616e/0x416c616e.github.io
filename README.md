## Alan's 100 Days of Code (alans100daysofcode.com)

This is my website where I post daily updates about my programming and learning. I've gone to college for IT and computer science, which I will resume in the fall. But right now, among other things, I am teaching myself a lot of prorgamming on my own, and making a software portfolio consisting of many open source personal projects.

Currently, the site was made with Jekyll. However, I am working on a static site generator of my own called Static Site Generator, which is being written in Python. Eventually, that will replace Jekyll. I am making my own tools and it's very fun, educational, and empowering to do so.

My main website, at least for now, is still [Saint Louis Software](https://saintlouissoftware.com). As the name implies, Alan's 100 Days of Code is just a temporary project, which will over after 100 days. Maybe I will continue to do a lot of programming after that, but there might be other things going on that will take precedence over open source. But I will at least be finishing the #100daysofcode challenge. 

It's been really great so far and I highly encourage other people to try it too (if you haven't already). I had prior programming experience, but even beginners can try it. It's cool to look back and see what you did in an approximately 3 month time frame.

## Converting to a book

After it's done, I will convert the entries to a book, maybe called something like Musings On Open Source Software Development.

## Future topics to write about

- Degradation of privacy
- Monetizing open source
- Open source vs. proprietary -- more than just licenses, mention features
- Open source community
- Security auditing
- The money behind open source
- Bit rot
- The tools I use
- Why I prefer multi-platform stuff
- GNU and getting out of touch by opting out of modern stuff because you dislike some aspects of it
- FOSS vs. proprietary pragmatism
- Social acceptability of certain software, and how some people will only use an app or program because other people they know use it
- Use-cases for Linux, and how it's not really great as a desktop OS
- Those who can do, and those who can't teach -- talk about bad coding tutorials made by people who haven't written anything except tutorials
- List some good tech books I've read (such as The Cathedral and the Bazaar)
- Incorrect tech predictions from the past -- where are our flying cars?
	- Relate old inaccurate tech predictions to current ones
- Fads vs. timeless concepts
- The future of programming -- increased abstraction
- Performance issues with web development
- How software business models are changing
- Bit rot
- Features vs. security
- Old-school bad purist ideas about programming (such as c2, cat-v, suckless)
- Company culture -- cubicles vs. open floor plans
- Changing developer culture and the new social acceptance of tech
- Industry trends that wax and wane, such as terminals -> PCs -> cloud
- Who is cloud good for? Well, cloud hosting providers, mostly.
- People pitching their vague and bad app ideas
- When people are wrong about tech and will not budge even when you tell them otherwise
- Bad tech startups that make more money from angel investors than customers
- Other areas for tech, aside from Silicon Valley (Beijing, Austin, etc.)
- Technology isn't really here until it's affordable -- we currently have robot assistants, and other expensive/impractical tech, but unless the cost goes down and it becomes more useful, to justify the cost, then it's just a novelty
- Early adopters vs. waiting until something is more tried-and-true
- RISC-V and open source hardware
- My experiences with 3D printing
- Automation and some misconceptions about it
- Neural networks -- changing things randomly and hoping it gets better
- Containers and container orchestration
- How higher levels of abstraction allow for people to forget about lower-level stuff, and how this can lead to problems later down the road, where people forget things and people retire, so there's legacy or underlying low-level hardware stuff that is important but people don't know how to maintain or use it
- Backlash against data mining, Facebook is an uncool company
- Shorter lifespan for tech companies compared to other industries
- How tech is changing non-tech industries
- My early years of trying to program, but knowing nothing about it, and doing things the wrong way (starting in like 2007)
- Marketing yourself on social media ("personal branding")
- Interview stuff
- People think reading books makes you smart, but it's kind of a dying medium, compared to websites, apps, social media, etc.
- How certain things in this writing/book will become obsolete by the time some people read it in the future
	- Watching old Defcon talks or old tech tutorials is a weird experience, because in its time, they were new and relevant and high-tech, and now, they just look old and obsolete
- Securing yourself is harding than hacking -- it's asymmetric
- Non-traditional programmers -- self-taught, night classes, older than most students, open source, but not necessarily working as a software developer
- How to deal with a client whose software requirements are bad and need to be revised
- Write more about malware, scams, etc. Examples: rootkits, link shorteners, trojanized torrents, and so on.
- The downsides of tech -- how it's bad for us, physically and mentally (sleep, f.lux, instant gratification, etc.)
- What you want your code to do isn't the same as what it actually does
- Nostalgia and old tech -- it can be old and inferior, but people think fondly of it anyway
- Dangers of social media
- Writing for programmers vs. writing for non-technical audiences
- Why are security researchers expected to also be great public speakers?
- Tech snake oil
- Cryptocurrency and its numerous problems
- Dark web, deep web, etc.
- Talking with people online who are from different parts of the world
- New social media is self-absorbed, but old web forums were more about interacting with other people
- No current social media will be around forever, it all has a limited shelf life
- When developing software, think about the user, who might not be from a tecnical background
- The digital divide
- Being the family tech support person even though you're primarily a software developer, not in computer repair
- How and why I got into tech
